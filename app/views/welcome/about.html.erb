<h1>About Eph Now</h1>

<h2>Eph Now Origins</h2>

<p>I, Oluwatobi Popoola, did not come up the idea for a space for Williams students to share personal experiences. I only claim ownership of the coding using to program the website, and nothing else. What I mean by this, is that the stories of triumphs and tragedy, sadness and success were always around at Williams College. I listened to a fair amount of students who shared everything in the spectrum possible about the campus, and the honesty of their perspective stayed with me much longer afterwards than the actual words. There likely are many spaces on campus to share your own story, I merely created my own version. Eph Now is not my project, merely a vision.</p>



<h3>My Wishes</h3>


<h4>I want Eph Now to serve a multitude of purposes for Williams students, with none taking precedence over the other.</h4>
<p>
A place for those whose inner voices are louder than the ones we hear from their mouths.
A place for those who feel as though they will be judged in a different platform or media. 
A place for those interested in learning about the different experiences of our community that can't exactly go on a brochure or public forum.
A place for those to reflect and consider the viewpoints of things at a different angle.
Lastly, a place to procrastinate when Facebook occasionally gets dry.
</p>


<h5>Some Other Thoughts</h5>


 <p>This of course is a personal opinion of mine, but feel that controversial topics are healthy for any community. So just because someone may write about a topic that we don't exactly vibe with or particularly respect, does not mean it should be erased. It is only when it significantly threatens to hurt or blatantly attack that we should intervene.
I hope that many people use Eph Now.
I hope I can follow up with a series of updates to further improve the website and add requested features.
I hope WSO and their fans do not get uptight.
I hope that you guys could help me out in my perspectives and ideas,  as I am very imperfection and could not do this alone. Any criticism and suggestion is great. </p>
